# MemsX
MemsX Roblox Executor. Download the .RAR 
MemsX is a level 7 lua executor. It it using "WeAreDevs_API.dll" If your anti virus deletes it, Please go download it and turn off your anti-virus link: https://wearedevs.net/d/Exploit%20API
BUT for safety reasons please scan your PC 1st before turning off your anti-virus because well, I don't want your PC to get wrecked.
(For the API just put it in the folder.)
Open the .RAR
Run "MemsX.exe" Don't worry its safe just anti-viruses flag it as a virus because of the software type (Cheating software)
Boom your done! Now find a script you'd like to execute but before executing make sure your in a roblox game and press "Attach"
It will inject the .dll file into Roblox.
